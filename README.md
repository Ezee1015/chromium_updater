Welcome to the Open Source Chromium Browser!

This proyect is a fork from the orginal creator: scheib.

With these scripts you can install Chromium in your home directory. You must have the crontab installed for the automatic updates and have the folders in English, otherwise you must edit the install script to change it for the name of your Desktop folder.

For the instalation you have to download this package and unzip it. After that you have to go to the unziped folder from a terminal and execute this line of code in that folder:

sudo bash ./Install.sh

And with this it installs chromium in ~/Chromium and creates desktop's shortcut to the application.

Thank you! All the aportation and comments are good recived!.
