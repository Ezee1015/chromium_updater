# chromium-updater

### Welcome to the Open Source Chromium Browser!

This proyect is a fork from the orginal creator: scheib.

**With these scripts you can install Chromium in your home directory**. You must have the crontab installed for the automatic updates (Next function), have installed the function "notify-send" and have the folders of your home directory in English, otherwise you must edit the install script to change it for the name of your Desktop folder.

## Instalation:

  For the instalation you have to download this package and unzip it. After that you have to go to the unziped folder, copy it to ~/.Chromium and from a terminal, execute this line of code in that folder:
```
sudo bash ./update.sh
sudo bash ./run.sh
```
And with this it installs chromium in ~/.Chromium and creates desktop's shortcut to the application.

## Ready To Go!

Thank you! All the aportation and comments are good recived!.
