### Welcome to the Open Source Chromium Browser!
This project is a fork from the original creator: scheib. And I have to say thanks to gamgi to give me the idea for the Mac OS implementation in the functionality of this script.
**With these scripts you can install and Update Chromium in your home directory in GNU/Linux and Mac OS X**. You must have the crontab installed for the automatic updates (Next function), have installed the function "notify-send" and have the folders of your home directory in English, otherwise you must edit the install script to change it for the name of your Desktop folder.
## Instalation:
  For the instalation you have to download this package and unzip it. After that you have to select the unziped folder, move it to ~/.Chromium (changing te name of that folder to ".chromium" and put it in your home directory), so, from a terminal, execute this lines of code one by one:
```
cd ~/Downloads
git clone https://github.com/sudo-Eze/chromium_updater
mv chromium_updater ~/.chromium
cd ~/.chromium/
sudo bash INSTALL.sh
```
  And with this it installs chromium in ~/.Chromium and open it when it finalizes.

## Ready To Go!
  Thank you! All the aportation and comments are good recived!.
